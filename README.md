# Mine Rush  -- **ALPHA**
## DISCLAMER
Mine Rush is written in Skript and will only be updated whenver I feel like it.
## Description
Mine Rush is a mini game in minecraft where players get teleported to a random location with the objective on earning as many points as possible. Points can be obtained through mining almost any type of block and can be spent in the minigames shop. Every 15 minutes the difficulty will increase making it more and more difficult to earn points where eventually the player will die and all points earned will be uploaded to the servers leaderboard and stats page!

## Dependencies
As of the latest version Mine Rush can only be played when one player is online on a server (LAN servers recommended), compatibility with multiplayer is coming with the full release of the game.

Required plugins and tested versions:
Skript 2.13.1
SkBee 3.13.1
